## What's Authenticator?

Authenticator is a native and modern Mac app designed for generating one-time password (i.e. TOTP security tokens defined by [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)), which has been used by many popular Internet services as their manner of implementing two-factor verification. You'd like to think of it as a modern Mac version of [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator).

## Roadmap

- does not collect information about your system
- won’t ask you to allow access to your any unneccesary sensitive data
- doesn’t have to connect to the internet to do its work
- won't upload your accounts to someone else
- will never steal your wife and enslave your children
