## What's Authenticator?

Authenticator is a native and modern Mac app that generates one-time password (i.e. TOTP security tokens defined by RFC 6238) that can be used with the two-step-verification of so many popular Internet services (such as Google, Evernote, GitHub, Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Linode etc.). You'd like to think of it as a modern Mac version of Google Authenticator.

## Features:

- Be compatible with all the populator OTP utilities such as Google Authenticator, Authy and OTP Auth
- Native and modern U
- Scan QR codes that include accounts and appear on the computer screen with an awesome QR codes picker
- Automatically lock in order to protect your vault against unexpected access
- Work offline
- Opened source under MIT license so that you can evaluate security, modify source code or contribute to this repo. I’m looking forward to see some other contributors :-)

## Roadmap:

- iCloud and Dropbox sync
- Notification Center widget for fast picking up passwords
- Scan QR codes that include accounts with Mac camera
- Supports counter-based (i.e. HOTP security tokens) passwords for special usage

## The app:

- does not collect information about your system
- won’t ask you to allow access to your any unneccesary sensitive data
- doesn’t have to connect to the internet to do its work
- won't upload your accounts to someone else
- will never steal your wife and enslave your children

Amazing huh? It’s thanks to the mathematics and my sense of morality to make all of above “don’t, won’t and never" possible. Happy authenticating!
